Multi-language Entities
=======================

A sample project to illustrate the possibility to generate different target languages
from models in MPS.

-----------------------
The com.dslfoundry.plaintextgen language is being utilized to model the implementation
domain in Python and Ruby as plain-text documents.
By changing the "Language engaged on generation" value for the sandbox model you can select
the desired output language from plain text documents, Python or Ruby.
